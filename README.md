This is a website that serves my blog post with some visuals along with a book on how to make your own programming language. 

***Which I didn't make BTW so if you can consider supporting the guy that made the book***


### How to run

## Add the submodules once they're available and everything is setup ( I will start adding things gradually )

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now you should see the source code for the other repositories
